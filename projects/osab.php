        <h1>Overview Of The Project:</h1>
        <p>A short answer is: it is an open source, autonomous, 3d printed, sea-going, solar powered, boat that will collect data on the ocean for scientific research. But there is a lot more than that. The goal of this project was to design an autonomous boat that could be printed on most mid-sized 3D printers and that would require little skill to make unlike other similar boats that are make from carbon fiber or fiberglass.</p>
